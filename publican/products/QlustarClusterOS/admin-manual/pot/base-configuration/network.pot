The DHCP server configuration file is <filename>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</filename> (type <command>man dhcpd.conf</command>) and is auto-generated by QluMan. There is a general or global section and a per node section in this file. The global section determines values that are to be applied to all the nodes registered within the <filename>dhcpd.conf</filename> file. On the contrary, the contents of a node section applies only to that specific machine and is created from the corresponding host info of the QluMan database.

All IP packets with unofficial sender IP addresses and a destination in the public LAN are then translated by the head-node to packets with its own official IP address. When a reply packet arrives, it is translated back to the unofficial IP address of the originating node inside of the cluster. The head-node works as a router in this case.
