msgid "Typically, a head-node has two mirrored boot disks. Sometimes it also holds additional data disks, that are setup either as a mirror, a RAID 5/6 or are part of an external storage system. The boot disk (or the RAID device in case of a RAID boot setup) is used as a physical volume for the basic system LVM volume group (default name vgroot). See <xref linkend=\"admin-man-sect-vol-man\" /> for more details on LVM. The system volume group is the container of the following logical volumes: root, var, tmp, swap, apps and data (the latter can also be chosen to be located on a separate volume group made from additionally available disks during installation). Each of these logical volumes is used as the underlying block device for the correspondingly named file-system. Hence, the whole head-node setup, including the / (root) file-system is typically under control of LVM, adding large flexibility for storage management."
msgstr ""

msgid "All additional disks or RAID sets are partitioned with a single partition of type LVM, and used as LVM physical devices. Static mount configuration for file-systems is entered in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. All file-systems are of type ext4 unless requested otherwise."

msgstr ""

msgid "NIS (Network Information System) is used as the cluster wide name service database. User account (passwd and shadow map) and group information (group map), hostname resolution (hosts map), auto-mounter (auto.master, auto.apps, auto.data), netgroup and services are the most important maps. The head-node is configured as a NIS master server when running <command>qlustar-initial-config</command> during installation. In case of a HA head-node setup, the second head-node becomes a NIS slave server."
msgstr ""

msgid "The generated NIS databases are located on the NIS master server under <filename>/var/yp</filename> and the corresponding source files in the directory <filename>/etc/qlustar/yp</filename>. The passwd and shadow tables are updated automatically by the script <filename>adduser.sh</filename> when users are added (see <xref linkend=\"admin-man-sect-add-user\" />) and the host map is automatically generated from QluMan. Apart from that, usually nothing needs to be changed in the provided NIS configuration. For security reasons, the file <filename>/etc/qlustar/yp/shadow</filename> should be readable and writable only by root. In case NIS source files have been changed manually, the command <command>make -C /var/yp</command> must be executed to regenerate the maps and activate the changes. For more detailed information about NIS, you may also consult the NIS package HowTo at <filename>/usr/share/doc/nis/nis.debian.howto.gz</filename>."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another important security aspect is the access restriction to the NIS server. Only the compute-nodes should be allowed to contact the NIS server. In case the head-node is also used as a work-group NIS server, additional access can be allowed for the corresponding subnet to which the work-group workstations are connected. The access settings are configured in <filename>/etc/ypserv.securenets</filename> (see <command>man ypserv</command>)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The master NIS server is also its own client. The corresponding configuration for the NIS client (ypbind) process is set in <filename>/etc/yp.conf</filename>. The NIS domain name is set in <filename>/etc/defaultdomain</filename> and usually defined as <parameter>qlustar</parameter>. On cluster nodes booting over the network, these settings are all configured automatically by DHCP (see also <xref linkend=\"admin-man-sect-dhcp\" />)."

msgid "<primary>Services</primary> <secondary>NFS</secondary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "To ensure a cluster wide homogeneous directory structure, the head-node provides NFS (Network File System) services to the compute-nodes. The kernel NFS server with protocol version 3 is used for accomplishing this goal. The typical Qlustar directory structure consists of three file-systems that are exported by the head-node via NFS to all other nodes: <filename>/srv/apps</filename>, <filename>/srv/data</filename> and <filename>/srv/ql-common</filename>. Note that in NFS version 4, one directory serves as the root path for all exported file-systems and all exported directories must be a sub-directory of this path. To achieve compatibility with NFS 4 in Qlustar, the directory <filename>/srv</filename> is used for this purpose. While <filename>/srv/apps</filename> and <filename>/srv/data</filename> are typically separate file-systems on the head-node, the entry <filename>/srv/ql-common</filename> is a bind mount of the global Qlustar configuration directory <filename>/etc/qlustar/common</filename>. This mount is generated from the following entry in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>:"

An export entry with the parameter <parameter>no_root_squash</parameter> for a host will enable full write access for the root user on that host (without that parameter, root is mapped to the user nobody on NFS mounts). In the following example, root on the host login-c (default name of the FrontEnd node) will have full write access to all exported file-systems:"
