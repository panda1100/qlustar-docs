msgid "Qlustar is a complete Linux distribution based on Debian/Ubuntu. The main focus of Qlustar is to provide an Operating System (OS) that simplifies the setup, administration, monitoring and general use of Linux clusters. Hence we call it a <emphasis>Cluster OS.</emphasis><indexterm><primary>Operating System</primary><secondary>Cluster OS</secondary></indexterm>"

msgid "A Qlustar HPC cluster typically consists of one or more head-nodes, and a larger number of compute/storage nodes. For better stability and security, it is highly advisable to separate user logins onto dedicated FrontEnd (FE) nodes. The latter can run on real physical hardware or (especially on small clusters with just a few users) in a virtual machine. Qlustar allows the setup/configuration of a KVM FE node during installation. and also add storage nodes serving a parallel file system (e.g. Lustre). All of the machines are usually connected through an Ethernet network. If fast inter-node communication is required, an additional high-speed interconnect like Infiniband, Myrinet or SCI (Dolphin) can be installed. Most of the time, the compute nodes are stripped down servers with IDE/SATA hard discs, often without keyboard and mouse connection. Users typically access the cluster either through the head or login nodes (if present)."
