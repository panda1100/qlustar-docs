msgid "Updating a <productname>Qlustar</productname> cluster is a multi-step process. The detailed steps depend on whether the update involves a kernel update or not (the release notes will mention it, if a new kernel is part of the update) and what module versions you have selected for your images. We'll explain the differences below. Follow the steps in the following order."

In this case the image is rebuilt, if either the update entails a new feature release (e.g. 8.2, the latest 8.2.z will then become the new real image version) or a new maintenance release (e.g. 8.1.2 which will then become the new real image version) or an update for the currently installed (8.1.1) modules. With this option, manual intervention to obtain a new image version is only necessary when upgrading to a new major release (e.g. 9.y.z)."
