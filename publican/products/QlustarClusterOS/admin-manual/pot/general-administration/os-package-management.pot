msgid "<primary>Package Management</primary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ubuntu/Debian package management is based on the concept of package sources or repositories. A configuration file <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> (or separate files in the directory <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</filename>) specifies the location of package sources."
msgstr ""

msgid "When a package is to be installed, all package source locations are checked whether they contain the desired package. If the desired package is found in only one package repository that one is taken, if it is found in more than one, then the package with the newest version is installed."

In principle, this is achievable in a couple of ways, each one requiring more or less handwork depending on the type of application in question.

It has the additional advantage that it works appropriately for any kind of application."
