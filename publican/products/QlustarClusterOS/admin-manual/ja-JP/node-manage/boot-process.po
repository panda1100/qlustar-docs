msgid "The boot process of the compute-nodes follows precise rules. It takes place in four steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The PXE boot ROM of the network card sends a DHCP request. If the node is already registered in QluMan, the request is answered by the DHCP server running on the head-node(s), allowing the adapter to configure its basic IP settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "The boot ROM requests a PXE loader program from the TFTP server on the head-node (the TFTP server specified by DHCP could also be on another node, but this is not the default). The PXE loader is then sent to the compute-node via TFTP."

There is a default configuration that applies to any node without an assigned custom boot configuration in QluMan.

The links are named after the node's <parameter>Hostid</parameter>, which you can find out with the <command>gethostip</command> command.

msgid "The RAM-disk image is the file-system holding the node OS that is mounted as the root filesystem of the compute-nodes. It is assembled on the head-node(s) from the image modules, you are able to select in QluMan. Every RAM-disk image contains at least the core module. See the corresponding section of the <link xlink:href=\"../QluMan_Guide/index.html#sec-Qlustar-OS-Images___blank___\">QluMan Guide</link> for more details. All available image modules are displayed and selectable in QluMan and the configuration and assembly of images is done automatically from within QluMan."

msgid "By default, the root password of a Qlustar OS image and hence the node booting it, is taken from the head-node(s) <filename>/etc/shadow</filename> file and is therefore the same as on the head-node(s). If you want to change this, you can call <command>qlustar-image-reconfigure &lt;image-name&gt;</command>. (Replacing &lt;image-name&gt; with the actual name of the image). You can then specify a different root password for the node OS image."

msgid "Any Qlustar node OS image contains changelogs of the various image modules it is composed of. They are located in the directory <filename>/usr/share/doc/qlustar-image</filename>. The main changelog file is <filename>core.changelog.gz</filename>. The other files are automatically generated. The files <filename>*.packages.version.gz</filename> lists the packages each module is made of. The files <filename>*.contents.changelog*.gz</filename> lists the files that were changed between each version, and <filename>*.packages.changelog*.gz</filename> list differences in the package list and versions. Hence, you always have detailed information about what has been changed in new images as well as the package sources of their content."
