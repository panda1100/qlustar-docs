msgid "A number of configuration options are configured dynamically when a node boots. These settings will be stored either in the file <filename>/etc/qlustar/options</filename> or in a separate file in the directory <filename>/etc/qlustar/options.d</filename> of the nodes root filesystem. Usual BASH shell syntax is used for the options. An example for the latter are the configuration settings for a nodes Infiniband stack. They will be placed in the file <filename>ib</filename>, which is created on the fly by the QluMan execd process while booting (see also the <xref linkend=\"admin-man-sect-qluman-execd\" xrefstyle=\"template:previous section\" /> and <xref linkend=\"admin-man-sect-infiniband\" />)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The settings in <filename>/etc/qlustar/options</filename> as well as the config files generated in <filename>/etc/qlustar/options.d</filename> should usually not be edited manually. However, when a node has trouble starting certain services or configuring some system components, it can make sense to inspect and possibly change the settings in these files to see whether that solves the problem. Please report such a situation as a bug, so that it can be fixed in a future release."

msgid "The dhclient process started during the boot process of compute-nodes will configure the IP addresses and other parameters given. By default, only the network interface from which the node boots is managed by DHCP. In a QluMan boot config, you can set the kernel parameter <parameter>dhcp_ifaces</parameter> to a comma separated list of interface names to manage other interfaces as well. Example: <parameter>dhcp_ifaces=eth0,eth1</parameter>. The first interface in this list is the primary interface. Extended information like NIS-domain and NIS-servers is queried through this interface."

msgid "Setting <parameter>dhcp_ifaces=bond0:eth0:eth1</parameter> you can easily define a bonding interface. This line would cause the interfaces <interfacename>eth0</interfacename> and <interfacename>eth1</interfacename> to act as slave interfaces associated to <interfacename>bond0</interfacename>. You can add additional options for the bonding interface separated with plus signs. These options include mode (defaults to 0) and miimon (defaults to 100).
