msgid "The Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM) provides a convenient and flexible way of managing storage. Storage devices like hard discs or RAID sets are registered as <literal>physical volumes</literal>, and are then assigned to volume groups. Volume groups contain one or more <literal>logical volumes</literal>, which can be resized according to the storage space available in the volume group. New physical volumes can be added to or removed from a volume group at any time, thereby transparently enlarging or reducing the storage space available in a volume group. Filesystems are created on top of logical volumes."
