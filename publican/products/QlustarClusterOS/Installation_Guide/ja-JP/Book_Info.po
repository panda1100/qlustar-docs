msgid "This document describes the necessary steps to install the Qlustar operating system. The Qlustar installer has been kept simple, yet it should include all necessary installation options a HPC cluster head-node needs. A setup with redundant (HA) head-nodes is supported, but such a configuration is a lot more complex and beyond the scope of this guide. Note, that this will require (a) a carefully chosen hardware configuration, (b) quite some manual configuration and (c) a lot of testing to ensure reliable operation."
