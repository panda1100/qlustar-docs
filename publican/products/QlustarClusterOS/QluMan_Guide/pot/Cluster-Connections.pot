msgid "When starting <application>qluman-qt</application>, it requests the password for your <firstterm>certificate safe</firstterm>. This safe holds the login information for your clusters together with the private keys for the corresponding QluMan user account. The password for the certificate safe is required on every start and whenever changes to the safe need to be written. You can have the client remember the password for the duration it is running by checking the <classname>Remember password</classname> check-box. Without enabling this, you will have to input the password again, whenever changes to the safe need to be written. If you are starting <application>qluman-qt</application> for the first time and therefore have no certificate safe yet, this dialog is skipped and an empty <classname>Connect Cluster</classname> dialog opens directly.

The last cluster used will be pre-selected but a different cluster can be selected from the drop-down menu. Click the <guibutton>Connect</guibutton> button to connect to the selected cluster. If this is the first time you connect to this cluster, the client generates a random public/private key pair. These keys will eventually be used for permanent authentification of the chosen user with this cluster. Following this, a connection to the server is made with an attempt to authenticate the client using the one-time token. On success, the server stores the public key of the client for future logins and the client stores both the private and public keys in the certificate safe. This finalizes the initial handshake."

For future connections, it will use the stored key pair to connect and authenticate. The safe contents will then not be changed again."
