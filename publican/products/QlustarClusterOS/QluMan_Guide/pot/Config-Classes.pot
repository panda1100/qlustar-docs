msgid "Overview"
msgstr ""

msgid "<classname>Config Classes</classname> manage configurations that are too complex to fit into the key + value scheme used by properties. Therefore, there is no common interface to configure all classes. Instead, each class has its own configuration dialog, presenting the specific options it provides. Furthermore, some classes depend on sub-classes (e.g. <classname>Boot Configs</classname> depend on <classname>Qlustar Images</classname>). Only the top-level <classname>Config Classes</classname> are directly assignable to a <classname>Config Set</classname> or a host. Sub-classes are assigned indirectly via their parent class. Most of the functional subsystems of <productname>Qlustar</productname> have a dedicated <classname>Config Class</classname>. Currently, there are four of them: <classname>Boot</classname>, <classname>DHCP</classname>, <classname>Disk</classname>, and <classname>Slurm Configs</classname> complemented by a single sub-class, <classname>Qlustar Images</classname>."

msgid "<productname>Qlustar</productname> has a powerful mechanism to manage the configuration of disks on a node.

It basically allows for any automatic setup of your hard drives including kernel software RAID (md) and <firstterm>LVM</firstterm> setups. A detailed description of the syntax for disk configurations is <link xlink:href=\"http://fai-project.org/doc/man/setup-storage.html\"> available</link>. Since the OS of a <productname>Qlustar</productname> node is always running from RAM, a disk-less configuration is obviously also possible. Note, that for flawless operation this requires some extra configuration (handling of log messages and in/output of batch jobs) that will be explained in the <productname>Qlustar</productname> admin guide. Valid configurations require definitions for two filesystems /var and /scratch as well as swap space (see examples). To permit the initial formatting of a new disk configuration on a node, it must have assigned the <parameter>Schedule Format: always</parameter> generic property during the initial boot (see the discussion <xref endterm=\"PropConf-Sets\" linkend=\"PropConf-Sets\" />."
