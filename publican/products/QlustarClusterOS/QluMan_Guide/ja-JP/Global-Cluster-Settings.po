msgid "To be able to configure your cluster with <application>QluMan</application>, a license key needs to be installed. Without a valid key, an error will be displayed upon start-up and the QluMan daemon will only allow read-only operations. In read-only mode, you can have a look at all the settings, but you can't change anything."

msgid "After closing the error dialog the <classname>License Key window</classname> can be opened by selecting <guimenuitem>File</guimenuitem>-&gt;<guimenuitem>License Key</guimenuitem> in the main Menu. If you never installed a license key before, the window will come up mostly empty."

If you intend to use <classname>Qlustar Basic Edition</classname>, checkmark <guibutton>Free / non-profit license</guibutton> at the bottom of the dialog. Select <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to continue saving the key request in a file. Enter a file-name and save. You will now have to send an e-mail specifying the required number of nodes and features (see <link xlink:href=\"http://qlustar.com/order/___blank___\">our order page</link>) with this key file attached to <link xlink:href=\"mailto:order@q-leap.com?Subject=License%20request\">order@q-leap.com</link>"

msgid "Opening the cluster network config dialog"
msgstr ""

msgid "During the installation of Qlustar, the configuration parameters for the cluster network had to be entered and normally you won't need to change them. For the rare circumstances, where they do need to be changed, or in case you just want to verify the settings, you can select <guibutton>Manage Cluster</guibutton>-&gt;<guibutton>Network Config</guibutton> from the main windows menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note, that changing anything in this dialog involves a fundamental reconfiguration of the cluster setup, including rebooting the whole cluster. For this reason, changes in the <classname>Global Cluster Network Config</classname> do not take effect immediately after being changed in the dialog. They require a further confirmation by clicking the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button, that will then actually commit the changes."

msgid "Configuring Ethernet"
msgstr ""

msgid "The global cluster network config dialog"
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing the Ethernet network configuration is the most involved and requires several steps. In the <classname>Global Cluster Network Config</classname> there are 3 settings relevant for <firstterm>Ethernet</firstterm>: The Cluster Network IP address, the netmask and the cluster internal Head IP address. When changing the Cluster Network IP address or netmask, the IP addresses of all hosts configured in QluMan will be remapped to reflect their new values. This requires that the new netmask is large enough, so that the resulting network range can include all existing hosts in the cluster. Therefore, the GUI won't let you pick anything too small. If there are unused address ranges in your existing network and you need a smaller netmask than currently selectable, you will first have to change some host addresses so that all of them combined occupy a small enough subset of the current network."
msgstr ""

msgid "Changing the network address IP will automatically remap the cluster internal Head IP address as well, while changing the netmask will not. Note, that the Qlustar convention, to use the second last IP of the cluster network as the Head IP, is obviously not a requirement. Hence, this is not done automatically when changing the netmask. Furthermore, changing the Head IP involves some additional steps without which the nodes in the cluster won't function or even boot. The point is that the Head IP also appears in the <classname>Global DHCP Template</classname>, NIS Host header and SSH Hosts / Known Hosts. These templates are simple, freely editable text blobs. A change of the Head IP in the <classname>Global Cluster Network Config</classname> will not change them, so you need to check and adjust each of them manually."

msgid "Configuring an http proxy"

msgid "If the head-node does not have direct access to the Internet, a <parameter>http proxy</parameter> must be configured. Qluman uses this proxy to download packages from the <guilabel>Qlustar repository</guilabel>, when creating a new chroot. Click the checkmark before <guilabel>Http Proxy</guilabel> to enable proxy support and enter the hostname together with the port of the proxy. If the proxy requires authentication, click the checkmark before <guilabel>Authenticate</guilabel> and enter a username and password. Like usual, the new settings will only take affect, when you click the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button."
