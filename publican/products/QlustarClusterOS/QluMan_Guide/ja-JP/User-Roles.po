A reconnect of the GUI client is then triggered automatically. It forces the client to generate a new random public/private key pair and use the new one-time token to authenticate itself to the server. This procedure should be used to invalidate the old keys and replace them with fresh ones, in case a user suspects the certificate safe might have been compromised by an attacker."
