msgid "<classname>Host filters</classname> define a set of hosts by specifying any number of criteria. The set of hosts defined by a filter is dynamic: Changes made to the properties of hosts are automatically reflected in the hostlist a filter evaluates to. Every time a filter is used, the criteria defining it are evaluated from scratch. Hence, host filters provide a powerful tool to classify hosts into groups, in a way that will dynamically take into account changes made to the cluster. They can be used in various ways within <application>QluMan</application>:"

#, fuzzy
msgid "A filter can be added from the context menu (right mouse click) in the top area. For a host to show up in the filtered list (bottom part), it must pass all the filters added. Each filter may narrow down the list. Any number of filters can be added and they do not have to be unique. For example you can add a Hostname filter that selects all hosts that begin with <systemitem class=\"systemname\">beo</systemitem> and a Host Template filter that selects all <systemitem class=\"systemname\">Demo VM</systemitem> nodes. A host has to pass all top-level filters to show up. Currently, <application>QluMan</application> provides six top-level filters: Hostname, HostTemplate, Enclosure, HEADNODE, HEADNODES and ONLINE. Additional ones will be added in the future."

A \".*\" can be added to the front, to match anywhere in the hostname instead of matching against the beginning."

msgid "Besides the obvious, this can also be useful in finding hosts that are not configured correctly. For example, adding an empty Host Template filter and inverting it, will show all hosts without a Host Template. Adding a second filter, that selects all switches, power controllers and other special devices (they usually don't need a Host Template) and also inverting that, results in a list of all hosts, that are neither properly configured nodes (missing Host Template) nor special devices."

msgid "When constructing a filter, it is important to remember, that all top-level filters are subtractive. A host must pass all top-level filters to show up in the result. On the other hand, all patterns and sub-filters are additive. Matching any one of them within a top-level filter adds the host to the result of that filter. Hence, when subtractive behavior is desired for patterns or sub-filters, each pattern or sub-filter must be added to its own top-level filter. For example, to select all hosts that start with <systemitem class=\"systemname\">beo</systemitem> as well as end on \"1\", two Hostname filters have to be added."
